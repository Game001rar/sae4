# Instructions for Running the Python Program

To successfully execute the Python program, please follow these steps:

1. Place the Data File:
   - Ensure that the file you wish to analyze is located in the same directory as the Python scripts.

2. Install Dependencies:
   - Open a command prompt or terminal window.
   - Navigate to the directory containing your Python scripts.
   - Run the following command to install the required packages:

     ```bash
     python install.py
     ```

   - If the above command doesn't work, try:

     ```bash
     python3 install.py
     ```

   - Alternatively, you can use:

     ```bash
     py install.py
     ```

3. Execute the Main Script:
   - After installing the dependencies, run the main script using one of the following commands:

     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

     or

     ```bash
     python3 main.py
     ```

     or

     ```bash
     py main.py
     ```

Note:
- The appropriate command (`python`, `python3`, or `py`) may vary depending on your system configuration. If one doesn't work, please try the others.
- Ensure that Python is properly installed and added to your system's PATH.
